## Workbook

- You can run the code in these slides by opening
  `02-data-frames.R` and following along.
- **ALL** of the code you see on the screen today is in your
  workbook.
- You will learn more if you see the code run for yourself.
    - *This is technically an untested hypothesis. Sorry.*
- There are a few code examples I have had to comment out in order for
  my slides to build correctly. Feel free to uncomment most of this
  code (unless it is otherwise noted).
    - RStudio Shortcut - [CTRL]+[SHIFT]+c

# Data Frames

## What is a Data Frame?

- Historically - called a data.frame.
- Vectors are 1-dimensional *(length)*.
- Vectors can contain only one data type *(integer, character, date)*.
    - Vectors containing multiple data types are characters.
- Data frames are multi-dimensional.
    - Today, 2-dimensional data frames only.
    - There is *no* limit to the dimensionality of your data.
- Data frames can contain multiple data types.
    - This is enormously useful for analytical projects.
- This data structure is one of R's key competitive advantages.
    - Pandas!

```

## Your First Data Frame {.smaller}

- R comes with many demo data sets.
- Most of these are data frames.

```{r YOUR-FIRST-DATA-FRAME,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

## Loads the iris data set. It provides the measurements (cm)
## of the sepal length and width, and petal length and width,
## respectively, for 50 flowers from 3 species of iris.
data(iris)

```

**DEMO:** Four Ways To View A Data Frame:

1. Use the RStudio Interface. Top-Right Pane
2. Use the view command.  `View(iris)`.
3. Enter the name of the data fram into the REPL console.
    - Easiest, but inefficient for large data sets.
4. Use the head() and tail() commands.
    
## Data Frame Dimensions

```{r DATA-FRAME-DIMENSIONS,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## How many rows and how many columns are in iris?
dim(iris)

```

Returns:

>- `[1] 150   5`
>- Always: Rows, Columns

```{r DATA-FRAME-COL-NAMES,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## What are the name of the columns?
names(iris)

```

Returns:

>- `[1] "Sepal.Length" "Sepal.Width"  "Petal.Length" "Petal.Width"  "Species"`

## Use A Column {.smaller}

```{r USE-A-COLUMN,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## It is EASY to access a single column of data for use in analysis.
iris$Sepal.Length

```

Returns:

>- Nahh. We need to see a demo.

```{r AVERAGE-SEPAL-LENGTH,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## The Sepal.Length column is numeric. We can find it's average.
mean( iris$Sepal.Length )

```

Returns:

>- `[1] 5.843333`
>- R is picky. Capitalization ALWAYS matter.
>- Because this lets us work with a single vector, we can use the
>  indexing we learned earlier.

## Lower Case Column Names

```{r LOWER-CASE-COLUMN-NAMES,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## I'm lazy - I hate typing upper-case letters in column names.
## The tolower function can be used to make them lower case.
## We can then assign these new names to the col names of the
## iris data object. This makes life better.
names(iris) <- tolower( names(iris) )

names(iris)

```

Returns:

>- `[1] "sepal.length" "sepal.width"  "petal.length" "petal.width"  "species"`
>- The spaces in the code are for clarity. They are not required.

```{r PRACTICE-LOAD-A-DATA-FRAME, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## Q1: Load the 'mtcars' data set
##     mtcars is a data set about cars from the late 70's.


## Q2: What is the average Miles Per Gallon (mpg) and the standard deviation of mpg?
##     The 'mean' and 'sd' functions will be helpful for figuring this out.

```

- This is the last non-boat related example.
- From here on out, we're going to get our feet wet in some Titanic data.

# Importing Data

## Working Directory

- Like most programming languages, R has a working directory.
    - This is "root" folder of a project.
    - This concept is critical when using external files.
- Fortunately, you do not have to do this manually!


```{r WORKING-DIRECTORY, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## Knowing the current working directory is VERY important for
## interacting with external files. R prefers relative paths
## to external files. Avoid absolute paths when you can.
getwd()

```

## Set Working Directory

Ways to set the Working Directory:

1. Code (Example code below.)
2. RStudio has a menu option for this in the "Session" menu.
3. RStudio Project! (This is the best option)
    - In fact, it is so good, we are going to demo it.
    - And then you have to do it on your computer.

```{r SET-WORKING-DIRECTORY, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## Sets the working directory to a folder called sinking-boats.
## You don't want to run this unless it is a real folder.
## This isn't. So don't run it, until you modify it.
setwd("/home/andy/sinking-boats")

```

- If you do this in code, I recommend using UNIX-style slashes (/).

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Practice: Create A New R Project

```{r PRACTICE-CREATE-A-NEW-R-PROJECT, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## Create a new RStudio Project in the folder where you
## unzipped the workshop files. R will switch to this project
## automatically.

```

<br />

NOTE:

- If you aren't sure you are doing this correctly, let us know.
- Everyone needs to complete this done successfully.

# Import CSV

## Directory List

- Because we set the working directory, we can use relative paths in
  our code.


```{r DIRECTORY-LIST-1, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## To see the list of files in the current working directory.
dir()
```

- If you run this and don't see the .R files we are using, TELL US!

<br />

```{r DIRECTORY-LIST-2, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## To see the list of files in the data folder.
dir(path="data")

```

- In the first example, we implicitly used the default path, which is
".", AKA the current working directory.

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Import Titanic Data

```{r IMPORT-TITANIC-DATA, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## Imports the Titanic training data set from the data folder.
## After running this, you should see the tit_train data set in the
## Environment tab in RStudio.
ti_train <- read.csv("data/train.csv", as.is=TRUE)

```

NOTE:

- Tell us if you are having trouble with this.
- Setting `as.is = TRUE` lets us avoid importing the data in Factors.
    - We haven't talked about factors yet, but they often cause more
    problems than they are worth.
- *Why ti_train? This data set was originally set up by Kaggle for
  introducing people to Machine Learning. I wanted to make it clear it
  is "Titanic" data, but keep the training data set distinct from the
  test data set.*

##  <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Practice: Explore Titanic Data

- Use one of the tools we have leared today to look at `ti_train`.
- The `str()` command is another way to explore the data.
    - *This is one of my favorite commands because it is compact and
      works well from the command-line interface I prefer.*
- Documentation for the Kaggle Titanic data is available in
  `data/README.md`
    - Open this file with RStudio!

<br />

```{r PRACTICE-EXPLORE-TITANIC-DATA, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## Compactly display the structure of an arbitrary R object.
## This works on objects other than data frames, but that is
## what most people will use it for most often.
str(ti_train)

```

<div class="notes">

- Compactly display the internal *str*ucture of an R object, a
  diagnostic function and an alternative to ‘summary’ (and to some
  extent, ‘dput’).

</div>

## What Was That Command?

```{r WHAT-WAS-THAT-COMMAND, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,purl=TRUE}

## When you can't remember the name of the command you
## are looking for, RStudio offers command and variable
## completion to help make life easier.
is.

```

## Local Help

```{r LOCAL-HELP, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,purl=TRUE}

## Sometimes you need help with a specific command.
## R's built-in help is good. Not perfect. But good.
help(round)

## Hackers are universally lazy (that's why we became
## hackers). Typing help is too much work. A question
## mark accomplishes the same thing.
?round

```

- RStudio makes it easy to find and use R's built-in help.
- I suppose most of you will just use that.
