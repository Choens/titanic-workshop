# Titanic Workshop

Instructions and demo code for the Titanic Workshop at the 2015 SUNY Albany Open Source Fair.

## Required Prerequistes:

1. Have access to a laptop for personal use during the workshop.
2. Prior to the OSF, install R on this laptop.

    http://cran.r-project.org/
 
3. Run prereqs.R (COMING SOON!) to install needed packages. You will need an Internet connection for this script to work.
4. Download or clone this repo before coming to the workshop. There will be code examples you will want to have access to. You do not need to know how to use Git to participate in this workshop. You can just download this repo as a ZIP file.

    Note: This repo is NOT yet complete. I expect this to be ready by February 10, 2015.

## Optional Prerequisites:

- Install RStudio or other  text editor or R interface of your choice: 

    - http://www.rstudio.co/mproducts/RStudio/#Desk
    - http://ess.r-project.org/
    - http://www.walware.de/goto/statet

The presenter will switch demonstrate and use both RStudio and Emacs ESS. Participant may choose to use any R interface they choose. RStudio is the easiest to install and setup. ESS is the best for Emacs fans. Participants can use ANY operational interface, including the default R interpreter, but the presenter recommends installing RStudio if you don't have a pre-established / strong opinion about it.
