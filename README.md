# Titanic Workshop

Instructions and demo code for the Titanic Workshop at the 2015 SUNY Albany Open Source Fair.

## Required Prerequistes:

1. Have access to a laptop for personal use during the workshop.
2. Prior to the OSF, install R on this laptop.

    http://cran.r-project.org/
 
3. Run packages.R to install needed packages. You will need an
   Internet connection for this script to work. Feel free to just copy
   paste it into R / RStudio or run it with:

    setwd("path to folder holding packages.R")

    source("packages.R")

4. Download or clone this repo before coming to the workshop. There
   will be code examples you will want to have access to. You do not
   need to know how to use Git to participate in this workshop. You
   can just download this repo as a ZIP file.

    Note: This repo is NOT yet complete. I expect this to be ready by February 10, 2015.

## Optional Prerequisites:

- Install RStudio or other  text editor or R interface of your choice: 

    - http://www.rstudio.co/mproducts/RStudio/#Desk
    - http://ess.r-project.org/
    - http://www.walware.de/goto/statet

The presenter will lead the workshop using both RStudio and Emacs
ESS. Participants may choose to use any R interface they
choose. RStudio is the easiest to install and setup. ESS is the best
for Emacs fans. Statet is the best option of fans of Eclipse. There
are dedicated interfaces for Sublime and other popular text editors
such as Vim.

Participants may use R interface, including the default R interpreter,
but the presenter only claims to be knowledgeable of and support
RStudio / ESS. Use other interfaces, such as Statet, only if you feel
confident you can set up and configure them prior to the workshop.

## Setup

I will include more OS-specific instructions tonight. If anyone has
any problems getting setup for the workshop, please file a bug against
this project to get my attention and I'll work through it with you. If
you have problems installing R, RStudio or Emacs / ESS, file a bug
against this README file. If you have trouble installing the packages,
file a bug against packages.R.
