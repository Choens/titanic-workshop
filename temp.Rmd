# Hypothesis: Sex and Survival?

<img src="img/titanic-side.gif" width=100%>

<div class="notes">

- Do you hypothesize there is a relationship between someone's gender
  and their chances of surviving the Titanic?

</div>

## Sex

- Before we look for a relationship, we should look at sex alone.

```{r one-factor-table, echo=TRUE, results="raw"}

## One Factor Table.
table(ti_train$sex)

```

<br/>
*

> - There were more men than women.

## Survival by Sex - Cross Tab

```{r two-factor-table-1, echo=TRUE, results="raw"}

## Creates a 2x2 Cross Tab
tbl <- table(ti_train$survived, ti_train$sex)
tbl

```

<br/>
*

> - Even though there are more total men, more total women survived.

## Survival by Sex - Proportions {.smaller}

```{r two-factor-table-perc, echo=TRUE, results="raw"}

## Uses the tbl object we created previously.
prop.table(tbl, margin=2)

```

**Margin == 1**

- Proportions will total to 100% across each row.

**Margin == 2**

- Proportions will total to 100% across each column.

## Survival by Sex - Statistical Significance

- Are the observed differences statistically significant?
- Will not get into the p-value debate.

```{r two-factor-table-summary, echo=TRUE, results="raw"}

## For our porpoises, p < .05 is significant.
summary(tbl)

```

<br/>
*

> - Yes. The observed differences are statistically significant.

## Survival by Sex - Visualization {.smaller}

- So, what is our story here?

```{r plot-sex, echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height = 3, fig.width=3}

## Using ggvis, not base R.
##library(ggvis)  

##ti_train %>% ggvis( ~sex, fill=~as.character(survived) ) %>% layer_bars()
    
```

# Hypothesis: Age and Survival?

<img src="img/titanic-side.gif" width=100%>

<div class="notes">

- Sex correlates with the odds ratio of survival.
- What about age? Does it correlate with survival?
- Correlation does not imply causation, although in this example it
  generally does.
  
</div>
  
## Age - Histogram

- Age is a continuous variable.
- Bins (groups) age by 10 year age blocks.

```{r age-hist-all, echo=TRUE, fig.height=2, fig.width=3, fig.align="center"}

#### Plots a histogram of age. (You must remove NAs.)
##ti_train %>% filter(!is.na(age)) %>%
##        ggvis(~age) %>% layer_histograms( width=10)

```

## Survival x Age - Histograms {.smaller}

- What is our story here?

<div style="display:inline-block; margin:auto; float:left; width:48%;">

### Survivors

```{r age-hist-survivors, echo=TRUE, fig.height = 2, fig.width=3, fig.align="center" }

#### Survivors Only
##ti_train %>%
##    filter(!is.na(age), survived == 1) %>%
##        ggvis(~age) %>%
##                layer_histograms( width=10)

```
</div>

<div style="display:inline-block; margin:auto; float:right; width:48%;">

### Deceased

```{r age-hist-not-survivors, echo=TRUE, fig.height = 2, fig.width=3, fig.align="center"}

#### Deceased Only
##ti_train %>%
##    filter(!is.na(age), survived == 0) %>%
##        ggvis(~age) %>%
##                layer_histograms( width=10)

```
</div>

## Regression - Survival x Age Continued  {.smaller}
 
- Loess Curve
- Does this change our story any?

```{r age-loess, echo=TRUE, fig.height=2.75, fig.width=5}

## ## SE is shown as a loess curve.
## ti_train %>%
##     filter( !is.na(age) ) %>%
##         ggvis(~age, ~survived) %>%
##             layer_smooths()

```

## Regression - Survival x Age Continued  {.smaller}

- Density Plot x Survival

```{r age-densities, echo=TRUE, fig.height=2.5, width=3}

##ti_train %>%
##    filter( !is.na(age) ) %>%
##        mutate(
##            Survived = as.factor( ifelse(survived == 1, "Yes", "No"))
##           ,Age = age ) %>%
##               ggvis( ~Age) %>%
##                   group_by(Survived) %>%
##                       layer_densities( fill=~Survived )


```


##  All models are wrong, but some are useful

- Statistician George E P Box in "Science and statistics", Journal of the American Statistical
  Association 71:791-799

- Two Types of Error

    - False Positive (we let someone live who should have died)
    - False Negative (we kill someone who should have lived)

- Both types of errors negatively affect our models.
- Because this is a binary outcome, these are the only types of errors
  we can make.
