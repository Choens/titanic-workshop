## STOP

- This similar to how Excel and other data tools work.


- Make sure you know how to get help.
- You can also just use the RStudio interface.



## Code Examples

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

> x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)         ## Create ordered collection (vector).

> y <- x^2                    ## Square the elements of x.

> print(y)                    ## Print (vector) y.
[1]  1  4  9 16 25 36

> mean(y)                     ## Calculate average (arithmetic mean) of (vector) y; result is scalar.
[1] 15.16667

> var(y)                       ## Calculate sample variance.
[1] 178.9667

```

## Code Examples: Continued

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

> lm_1 <- lm(y ~ x)           ## Fit a linear regression model "y = f(x)" or "y = B0 + (B1 * x)".
                              ## Store the results as lm_1.
                               
> print(lm_1)                 ## Print the model from the (linear model object) lm_1.
 
Call:
lm(formula = y ~ x)
 
Coefficients:
(Intercept)            x

<div class="notes">

- For many users, R is a weird mix of the functional and object
oriented paradigms.
- If there are any LISP fans in the audience, you will feel right at
  home, once you get used to not typing endless parentheses.
- EVERYTHING is an object. EVERYTHING.
- Data, functions, etc. You can pass a function to a function as a
variable.
- Rather than create objects that have functions, R treats everything
  as an object, incuding functions. Functions, as objects, can inherit
  aspects of parent functions, thus you can have a function like
  length() which tells how how long a 1-dimensional object is. It has
  . . . more or less . . .  child functions that know how to deal with
  different types of one-dimensional objects. Yeah.

</div>


## Get Help

You can always get help:

- Prepend the name of a function with a single: '?'.
- Type in the name of a function, but not putting in the parentheses.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

?read.csv   ## This is generally the best and easiest way to get help.

read.csv    ## This is generally an accident, but it is also a learning opportunity.

```

## Local Help!

#### What Was That Command?

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,purl=FALSE}

is.

```

#### Help!

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,purl=FALSE}

## THESE ARE IDENTICAL!
?round
help(round)

## Working Directory

- Like most programming languages, R has a working directory.
- Because we want to interact with files outside of R, this is VERY important.

<br/>

<div style="display:inline-block; margin:1 auto; float:left; width:48%; text-align: left;">

#### Displays current working directory:
<br/>
```{r echo=TRUE}

getwd()

```

</div>

<div style="display:inline-block; margin:1 auto; float:right; width:48%;  text-align: left;">

#### Sets current working directory:

<br/>
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

setwd("/home/andy/my-funky-repo")

```

</div>

## Working Directory Continued

You do not have to set this manually!

- If you use RStudio, you can create projects and define the default
  working directory for each project.
- If you start an R script in Emacs ESS, it will ask you where to
  start R, defaulting to the directory holding the script.
- You should set your working directory to the root directory of the
  Git repo, titanic-workshop.

<div class="notes">

### PAUSE!

- The working directory concept is important because we are going to
  be importing data and functions into a live R session.
- Does everyone understand what their working directory should be?

## See Files

- For today's purposes, paths can be assumed to be relative to the
  working directory.

<div style="display:inline-block; margin:1 auto; float:left; width:48%; text-align: left;">

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

## Files in current working directory.
dir()

```

</div>

<div style="display:inline-block; margin:1 auto; float:right; width:48%; text-align: left;">

```{r echo=TRUE}

## Files in the data directory.
dir("data")

```

</div>

## Import / View Data

```{r echo=TRUE}

train <- read.csv("data/train.csv", as.is=TRUE)   ## Imports CSV data into R.


str(train)   ## Compactly display the structure of an arbitrary R object.


View(train)   ## Will open as a seaparate window, unless you are using RStudio.
              ## If you are using RStudio, it will open the data in the IDE.

```

# How To Write A Function

<img src="img/titanic-cobh-harbour-1912.jpg" width=75%>

## Our First R Function

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}

#' read.train
#' Imports the Titanic training data set.
#'
#' @return df A dataframe containing the imported dataset.
#'
read.train <- function( ) {
    ## Test to make sure there is something to import.
    if("train.csv" %in% dir("data")) {
        ## Imports the CSV data.
        df <- read.csv("data/train.csv")
        ## All the col names are lower case!
        names(df) <- tolower(names(df))
        ## Simplifies the name col
        df$name = as.character(df$name)
        return(df)
    } else {
        ## Stops us if R can't find the data.
        stop("Unable to locate train data set.")
    }
}   ## read.train

```

## Congratulations

- You are now a certifiable expert in R.
- Now it is time to get our analysis on.
