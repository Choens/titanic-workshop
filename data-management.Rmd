Place holder for data management stuff I pulled out.

## Selecting Data Columns- Numerically

- `ti_train[,"name"]` is similar to how we filter vectors.


```{r SELECTING-DATA-COLUMNS-NUMERICALLY, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

## Selects the first six entries in the names column numerically.
head( ti_train[,4] )

```
