## Workbook

- You can run the code in these slides by opening
  `03-eda-and-hypothesis-testing.R` and following along.
- **ALL** of the code you see on the screen today is in your
  workbook.
- The pace / complexity of this workshop is about to increase.
    - *That first slideshow is painfull*
- I am going to demo more code. But I want you running code too.
    - PRACTICE v. Demo Slides
    - *Doing is learning.*

## Learning Objectives

- More Data Management
- Graphing / Plotting
- Contingency Tables
- Hypothesis Testing

<br />

### Note:

Principal Components Analysis and other more advanced EDA tools are
not part of today's workshop.

*I am interested in developing more modules for this workshop,

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Based on some notes I stole from Wikipedia:

- An approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main
  characteristics, often with visual methods.
- R's design was influences by Tukey and EDA.
- Tends to emphasize graphics / plotting.
- Fast and Dirty.
- Today, we will be using BASE R for our graphics. These are
  relatively easy to use, but are not necessarily beautiful.
    - The `ggplot2` and `ggvis` packages are more appropriate for
      producing publication ready graphics.

## Hypothesis Testing:

Based on some notes I stole from Wikipedia:

- AKA Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA)
- A method of statistical inference.
- Two statistical data sets are compared.
- The hypothesis is proposed for the relationship between the two data
  sets. This is compared as an alternative to a null hypothesis (no
  relationship between two data sets).
- Comparison is deemed statistically significant if the relationship
  would be an unlikely realization of the null hypothesis according to
  a threshold probability (the significance level).
- Today's example is the Chi Square test.
- I am not discussing Bayesian stats today.

## Data Import

```{r DATA-IMPORT, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

## Imports the Titanic Training Data and makes the col names lower case.
ti_train <- read.csv("data/train.csv", as.is=TRUE)
names(ti_train) <- tolower( names(ti_train) )

## Displays the number of rows / columns in the data frame.
dim(ti_train)

```

### Note:

- If you do not have the ti_train object in your current R session,
please let us know.

## What Did We Import? {.smaller}

```{r WHAT-DID-WE-IMPORT, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

# Fast, compact way of reviewing what data was imported.
str(ti_train)

```

- Additional documentation is available in `data/README.md`
    - Open this Markdown file with RStudio!

<div class="notes">

- Compactly display the internal *str*ucture of an R object, a
  diagnostic function and an alternative to ‘summary’ (and to some
  extent, ‘dput’).

</div>

## Selecting Data Columns {.smaller}

- There is *(always)* more than one way to sink a boat.
- Choose the approach that seems to work best in the circumstance.
- R convention for square brackets: `[ROWS, COLS]`
- Know where your comma is!

<div style="display:inline-block; margin:1 auto;float:left;width:48%;text-align:left;">

#### You can select a column by name:

```{r SELECTING-DATA-COLUMNS-NAME, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

## Selects first 6 entries in
## the name column.
head( ti_train$name )

```

</div>

<div style="display:inline-block; margin:1 auto;float:right;width:48%;text-align:left;">

#### Or use square brackets:

```{r SELECTING-DATA-SQUARE, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

## Selects first 6 entries in
## the name column.
head( ti_train[,"name"] )

```

</div>

<div class="notes">

R is like Perl, many different ways to do everything.

Use the method:

- you are comfortable with,
- you want to type,
- is appropriate at that moment.
  
</div>


## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Demo: Select a Row

- Uses a technique similar to indexing vectors.
- Question: Why are we using "==" here?
- Discuss: The location of the comma.

```{r DEMO-SELECT-A-ROW, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## Returns all rows where "name" is exactly "Montvila, Rev. Juozas".
## There is only one such row.
ti_train[ti_train$name == "Montvila, Rev. Juozas", ]

```

##  <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> PRACTICE: Filtering Data


- We can build on the last slide to select all rows which meet a
  specific criteria.

```{r PRACTICE-FILTERING-DATA, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## Returns all rows where the ticket cost is over 200.
## Remember, these are 1912 prices!
ti_train[ti_train$fare > 200, ]

```

##  <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Demo: Tricky Filtering Data

```{r DEMO-TRICKY-FILTERING-DATA, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## Returns all rows where age is over 75.
## What is different here?
ti_train[ti_train$age > 75, ]

```

<div class="notes">

- ALWAYS find the NAs early and deal with them.
- Or they will bite you.

</div>

##  <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Demo: Tricky Filtering Data NA

- The "&" lets us have more than one filter on the data.
- The "!" means not which inverts the Boolean test.
- Boolean tests are BEFORE the comma, this filter removes rows.

```{r DEMO-FILTERING-DATA-NA, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## This gives us ONLY those who are over 75 because it 
##  removes all rows where age is NA (like NULL).
ti_train[ti_train$age > 75 & !is.na(ti_train$age), ]

```

<br />

>- Boolean tests AFTER the comma wouldn't make much sense.

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Demo: How Many NAs?

- `is.na()` == `IS NULL` command from SQL.
- This is one way to see how many NA values you have.
- We'll learn another way in a minute.

```{r DEMO-HOW-MANY-NAS, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## Returns the number of rows where the age column is NA.
## Filters a vector pulled from a Data Frame.
length( ti_train$age[ is.na(ti_train$age) ] )

```

## Subset {.smaller}

- The way the square brackets handle NAs ~~can be~~ is annoying.
- The subset command feels familiar to new users but is infrequently
  used.
    - You won't find lots of examples of it on the Internet.
- R users tend to be comfortable with programming norms.
- Many Data Frames `-->` Memory constraints & a messy work environment.

```{r SUBSET, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE,results='hide'}

## The subset command is another way to filter data.
## Is usually used to create a new object.
## Creating many objects --> confusion AND high memory use.
## But, subset handles NAs in a saner way.

ti_old <- subset(ti_train, age > 75)
View( ti_old )

```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

<img src="img/titanic-side.gif" width=100%>

## Who was aboard Titanic?

- We will explore four factors.
    - Gender (sex)
    - Passenger Class (pclass)
    - Age (age)
    - Cost of Ticket (fare)

#### Caveats:

- Two data sets, train and test. We have only imported train.
- Counts shown are only half of the passenger manifest.
- Assume they are representative of passengers over-all.

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Demo: Contingency Table - Sex {.smaller}

A contingency table is an easy way to explore data.

```{r DEMO-CONTINGENY-TABLE-SEX, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

## Returns a contingency table of the sex column.
tbl_sex <- table( ti_train$sex )
tbl_sex

```

- The counts are 1/2 of the manifest. But the ratio between the two
  should be representative of the whole.

```{r DEMO-PRC-SEX, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

## Returns the percentages.
prc_sex <- prop.table(tbl_sex)
prc_sex

```

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Demo: Barplot Sex {.smaller}

The contingency table is helpful. But EDA is about seeing the numbers.

```{r DEMO-BARPLOT-SEX, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE, fig.height=4,fight.width=3,fig.align='center'}

## Plots the survival numbers from above.
barplot(tbl_sex)

```

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Practice: Passenger Class

```{r PRACTICE-PASSENGER-CLASS, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

## Q1. Build a contingency table of passenger class (pclass).
##     Call it tbl_pclass.


## Q2. Build a percentages contingency table of passenger class.
##     Call it prc_pclass.


## Q3. Draw a barplot of passenger class.
##

```

I try to use object names that have a pattern:

- tbl-foo: is a contingency table based on the foo column.
- prc-foo: is the proportions, from tbl-foo.

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Demo: Passenger Class

- R was **strongly** influenced by Tukey's book, Exploratory Data
  Analysis, published in 1977.
- R gives you full access to a REPL. You don't have to write a script.
- This high level of interactivity is a design feature, not an
  accident.

#### Mental Note To Self:

- Demo using the REPL to rapidly explore data.
- Start small. Wrap big.
- Starting with: `table(ti_train$pclass)`
    - Wrap this with `prop.table()` and `barplot()`

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Demo: Histogram Fare {.smaller}

```{r DEMO-HISTOGRAM-FARE, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4,fig.align='center'}

## Returns a histogram passengers fare costs.
## Basic usage is easy and intuitive.
## You aren't going to publish this. But it is useful EDA.
hist(ti_train$fare)

```

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Practice: Histogram Age

```{r AGE-HIST, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

## Q1: Create a histogram chart showing the age of passengers.
##
##

```

## "Fun" Facts About Titanic

- Titanic disembarked on her maiden voyage with roughly 1,317 passengers.
    - *Was Jack Dawson one of them????*
- Titanic was designed for a max 2,566 passengers.
- This tragedy could have been **much** worse.

## Questions:

- What proportion of passengers died?
- How can we identify factors which correlate with passenger survival?

## Survival

The `survived` column is numerical, but categorical.

```{r SURVIVAL, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

## Returns a row contingency table of the survived column.
## Remember: 1 == Yes, 0 == No
survival <- table( ti_train$survived )
survival

```

- The odds of surviving? Not good.
- 0 and 1 is hard to read.  We can do better.
- But, we'll want to keep this for the logistic regression.

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Demo: Lived

We can create an easier to read column.

```{r DEMO-LIVED, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

## Creates a new column, "lived" and fills it in.
## First, create a new column with NA data in it.
## Then, fill in the values you want.
ti_train$lived <- NA
ti_train$lived[ ti_train$survived == 1 ] <- "Yes"
ti_train$lived[ ti_train$survived == 0 ] <- "No"

## Returns a contingency table of the new lived column.
lived <- table( ti_train$lived )
lived

```

## Lived Proportions

```{r LIVED-PROPORTIONS, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, purl=TRUE}

## Creates a contingency table with proportions.
## This is similar to how it is done in SQL.
prc_lived <- round( 100*prop.table( lived ), 2 )
prc_lived

```

<br/>

- Fewer than 40% of passenger survived.

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Demo: Lived BarPlot

```{r LIVED-BARPLOT, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,purl=TRUE}

## Plots the lived proportions. Now fancier!
## Reverses Yes and No
## Labels the graph and the axes.
## Colors Output
## And adjusts the Y limit.
barplot(sort(prc_lived, decreasing=FALSE),
        main="Proportion of Titanic Passengers Who Lived",
        xlab="Lived?", 
        ylab="Percent of Passengers",
        col="darkblue",
        ylim=c(0,100)
        )

```

- If we increase the code complexity.
- We are rewarded with more sophisticated output.

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Demo: Lived BarPlot

```{r LIVED-BARPLOT-ACTUAL, echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE,purl=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

barplot(sort(prc_lived, decreasing=FALSE),
        main="Proportion of Titanic Passengers Who Lived",
        xlab="Lived?",
        ylab="Percent of Passengers",
        col="darkblue", 
        ylim=c(0,100)
        )

```

# Hypothesis Testing

<img src="img/titanic-side.gif" width=100%>

## Hypothesis

- When someone says the name "Titanic" most of us think of the
  infamous phrase "women and children first".
  - But, did it matter?

#### Formal Hypotheses:

- Children were more likely to survive than adults.
- Females more likely to survive than males.

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Children More Likely To Survive

```{r CHILDREN-MORE-LIKELY-TO-SURVIVE, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

## Creates a new column, "child" and fills it in.
ti_train$child <- NA
ti_train$child[ ti_train$age <= 18 ] <- "Child"
ti_train$child[ ti_train$age > 18 ] <- "Adult"


## Returns a 2x2 contingency table.
child_survival <- table( ti_train$child,ti_train$lived )
child_survival

```

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Children Survival Proportions

```{r CHILDREN-SURVIVAL-PROPORTIONS, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

## Proportion of children and adults who survived.
## Margin = 1 because 1 == ROWS, 2 == COLUMNS. ALWAYS
prop.table(child_survival, margin=1)

```

<br/>

- It seems likely that yes, children were more likely to survive.

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Children Survival Significance {.smaller}

```{r CHILDREN-SURVIVAL-SIGNIFICANCE, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

## Hypothesis: Children are more likely to survive.
## Run prop.test against the values, NOT the proportions.
prop.test(child_survival, alternative = "greater")

```

- The p-value is less that 0.05, so we can reject the null hypothesis.
- Yes children were more likely to survive.
- When passed a contingency table, R will calculate greater/less based
  on the FIRST COLUMN. Adjust your hypothesis accordingly.

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Summary

```{r SUMMARY, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

## The summary() function can be used
## to examine most R objects.
summary(child_survival)

```

- The summary() command tests for independence.
- Try this command on `ti_train`.
- What do you see? Is it useful?

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Mosaic Plot

```{r MOSAIC-PLOT, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE,fig.width=4,fig.height=4,fig.align='center'}

## The mosaicplot is another way of visualizing
## complex relationships and can scale effectively
## for many variables.
mosaicplot(child_survival)

```

- You cannot use this for testing independence.
- But it can be a useful visualization tool.

## <img src="img/captain-smith-super-small.jpg" height=50px> Practice: Sex & Survival

```{r PRACTICE-SEX-SURVIVAL, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}

## Q1: Create a 2x2 Contingency table for Lived and Sex.
##     Call it sex_survival.


## Q2: What is the proportion of men who lived, compared to
##     proportion of women?


## Q3: Is the observed difference between the sexes in the
##     survival rate statistically significant?
##

```
